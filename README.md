# MicroServices
Training in microservices development and deployment.

In this project, I learned how to create a microservice from scratch using Spring Boot. The steps I followed are:

- Created a new project using Spring Initializr, specifying the necessary dependencies, Java version, Maven, etc.

- Created a model that contains our entities to represent the data.

- Added a controller to define REST endpoints, and implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data.

- Tested the REST API using Postman to ensure it works as expected.

- Added a DAO (Data Access Object) layer that uses the Couchbase database and defined an interface that inherits from JPARepository.

- Used H2 Console to visualize and manipulate data in the database.

- Managed exceptions to ensure the application is robust and can handle errors gracefully.

- Added Swagger to document the REST API for other developers to use.

Overall, this project gave me a solid foundation in creating microservices with Spring Boot and using Couchbase as a database.
